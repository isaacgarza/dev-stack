## Overview
Transform dev-stack into a Go-based CLI tool with single binary distribution, automatic version management, and team consistency enforcement.

## Goals
- Single binary distribution with zero dependencies
- Global installation with project-level version enforcement
- Automatic version switching per project (like .nvmrc, .python-version)
- Team consistency - everyone uses same version for same project
- Zero configuration conflicts between projects
- Fast execution and startup times
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Architecture: Go Binary with Version Management

## Migration from Current Shell-Based Approach

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase-Based Approach**: Complete feature parity before removing legacy scripts
2. **Feature Parity First**: Ensure Go version has ALL current functionality before cleanup
3. **Safe Transition**: No functionality loss during migration
4. **Automated Testing**: Verify Go commands match shell script behavior
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update all references when legacy scripts are removed

### Migration Timeline (Updated)
- **Phase 1 ✅**: Foundation and basic CLI framework established
- **Phase 2 (Current)**: Achieve complete feature parity + remove legacy scripts
- **Phase 3**: Version management and advanced features
- **Phase 4+**: Enhanced developer experience and team features

### Legacy Script Removal Checklist
**⚠️ CRITICAL: Only remove scripts after implementing ALL equivalent functionality in Go**

**Shell Script Functions → Go Commands Mapping**:
- ✅ `show_status()` → `dev-stack status`
- ✅ `start_services()` → `dev-stack up`
- ✅ `stop_services()` → `dev-stack down`
- ❌ `show_logs()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack logs`**
- ❌ `exec_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack exec`**
- ❌ `connect_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack connect`**
- ❌ `backup_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack backup`**
- ❌ `restore_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack restore`**
- ❌ `cleanup()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack cleanup`**
- ❌ `monitor_services()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack monitor`**
- ❌ `scale_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack scale`**

**Python Script Functions → Go Implementation**:
- ❌ `generate_docs.py` → **MISSING: Go-based documentation generator**

**Ready for Removal When**: All ❌ items above are implemented and tested.
