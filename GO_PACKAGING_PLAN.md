## Overview
Transform dev-stack into a Go-based CLI tool with single binary distribution, automatic version management, and team consistency enforcement.

## Goals
- Single binary distribution with zero dependencies
- Global installation with project-level version enforcement
- Automatic version switching per project (like .nvmrc, .python-version)
- Team consistency - everyone uses same version for same project
- Zero configuration conflicts between projects
- Fast execution and startup times
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Architecture: Go Binary with Version Management

### Core Concept
```
Single Go Binary (dev-stack)
├── Version Detector (reads .dev-stack-version, config files)
├── Version Manager (downloads/manages multiple versions)
├── Project Detector (finds project root, detects conflicts)
├── Command Router (delegates to correct version or executes directly)
└── Service Orchestrator (Docker/Compose integration)
```
