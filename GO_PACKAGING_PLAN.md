### Version Management System Implementation

A comprehensive version management system has been implemented that allows dev-stack to manage multiple versions and automatically switch between them based on project requirements.

### New Features Delivered

- **Version Detection**: Automatic detection of project version requirements from `.dev-stack-version` files
- **Version Installation**: Download and install specific versions from GitHub releases
- **Version Switching**: Automatic delegation to the correct version based on project requirements
- **Multi-Project Support**: Isolated version management per project with conflict detection
- **Version Commands**: Complete CLI interface for version management

### Technical Implementation

- **Version Parser**: Full semantic versioning support with constraint parsing (`>=1.0.0`, `~1.2.3`, `^1.0.0`, etc.)
- **GitHub Installer**: Automated download and installation of versions from GitHub releases
- **Version Switcher**: Automatic binary delegation to the correct version
- **Project Detection**: Smart project root detection and version file discovery
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based storage for installed versions and project configurations

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Core Version Management Infrastructure**:
   - Semantic version parsing and comparison
   - Version constraint evaluation (>=, >, <, <=, ~, ^, *, etc.)
   - Version file detection and parsing (text and YAML formats)

2. **Installation and Management**:
   - GitHub release downloading with platform detection
   - Checksum verification for security
   - Version storage and registry management
   - Cleanup and garbage collection

3. **Automatic Version Switching**:
   - Project root detection (git repos, version files, common project files)
   - Automatic binary delegation based on project requirements
   - Fallback mechanisms for missing versions
   - Performance optimization to avoid unnecessary switches

4. **Multi-Project Support**:
   - Isolated version configurations per project
   - Conflict detection between projects
   - Project-specific version tracking
   - Shared service detection

5. **CLI Commands**:
   - `versions list` - List installed versions
   - `versions install <version>` - Install specific versions
   - `versions uninstall <version>` - Remove versions
   - `versions use <version>` - Set active version
   - `versions available` - List available versions from GitHub
   - `versions detect [path]` - Detect project version requirements
   - `versions set <version> [path]` - Set project version requirements
   - `versions cleanup` - Clean up old versions

- **Phase 2 (Current)**: Achieve complete feature parity + remove legacy scripts
- **Phase 3**: Version management and advanced features
- **Phase 4+**: Enhanced developer experience and team features

### Legacy Script Removal Checklist
**⚠️ CRITICAL: Only remove scripts after implementing ALL equivalent functionality in Go**

**Shell Script Functions → Go Commands Mapping**:
- ✅ `show_status()` → `dev-stack status`
- ✅ `start_services()` → `dev-stack up`
- ✅ `stop_services()` → `dev-stack down`
- ❌ `show_logs()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack logs`**
- ❌ `exec_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack exec`**
- ❌ `connect_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack connect`**
- ❌ `backup_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack backup`**
- ❌ `restore_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack restore`**
- ❌ `cleanup()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack cleanup`**
- ❌ `monitor_services()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack monitor`**
- ❌ `scale_service()` → **MISSING: `dev-stack scale`**

**Python Script Functions → Go Implementation**:
- ❌ `generate_docs.py` → **MISSING: Go-based documentation generator**

**Ready for Removal When**: All ❌ items above are implemented and tested.
