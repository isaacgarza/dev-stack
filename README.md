# Dev Stack - Local Development Environment Framework

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Compose-blue.svg)](https://www.docker.com/) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/isaacgarza/dev-stack)]

A modular, configuration-driven framework for setting up local development environments with Docker Compose. Define your services in a YAML configuration file and get productive instantly.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Ensure Docker is running
docker info

# 2. Initialize configuration file
./scripts/setup.sh --init

# 3. Edit the configuration file
vim local-dev-config.yaml

# 4. Set up and start services
./scripts/setup.sh

# 5. View service information
./scripts/manage.sh info
```

## üéØ Overview

This framework solves the common problem of setting up consistent local development environments across different projects and team members. Instead of maintaining separate Docker Compose files for each project, teams can:

- **Configure services declaratively**: Define your stack in `local-dev-config.yaml`
- **Choose services √† la carte**: Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Jaeger, Prometheus, LocalStack, etc.
- **Generate configurations**: Docker Compose, environment files, and Spring Boot configs
- **Manage everything**: Start, stop, backup, restore, and monitor services
- **Stay consistent**: Same setup across all team members and projects

### Key Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Configuration-driven**: Single YAML file defines your entire stack
- ‚úÖ **Plug-and-play**: Add to any project in minutes
- ‚úÖ **Consistent**: Same environment across team members
- ‚úÖ **Flexible**: Mix and match services as needed
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready**: Services configured with best practices
- ‚úÖ **Spring Boot integration**: Auto-generated configuration
- ‚úÖ **Smart validation**: Warns about resource usage and conflicts

## üõ† Available Services

### Databases
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database with custom DB/user creation
- **MySQL** - Alternative database option

### Caching & Storage
- **Redis** - In-memory data structure store

### Observability
- **Jaeger** - Distributed tracing
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and monitoring

### Cloud Services
- **LocalStack** - AWS services emulation (SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, S3, etc.)

### Messaging
- **Kafka** - Event streaming platform with custom topic creation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Configuration

The framework uses a `local-dev-config.yaml` file to define your development stack:

```yaml
# Basic configuration example
project:
  name: "my-api"
  environment: "local"

services:
  enabled:
    - redis
    - postgres
    - jaeger
    - localstack

overrides:
  postgres:
    database: "my_api_dev"
    username: "api_user"
  localstack:
    services: ["sqs", "sns"]
```

## üéõ Management Commands

```bash
# Configuration
./scripts/setup.sh --init                    # Create sample config
./scripts/setup.sh                          # Setup from config
./scripts/setup.sh --services=redis,postgres # Override services

# Service Management
./scripts/manage.sh start                    # Start all services
./scripts/manage.sh stop                     # Stop all services
./scripts/manage.sh restart                  # Restart services
./scripts/manage.sh info                     # Show service info

# Instance Management
./scripts/manage.sh list-all                 # List all instances
./scripts/manage.sh cleanup-all              # Cleanup all instances
```

## üîÑ Multi-Repository Usage

The framework intelligently detects when you're running multiple instances across different repositories and provides options to:

- **Connect** to existing running services
- **Cleanup** existing instances and start fresh
- **Cancel** and resolve conflicts manually

This prevents resource conflicts and ensures smooth development across multiple projects.

## üìÑ Generated Files

When you run setup, the framework generates:

- `docker-compose.generated.yml` - Complete Docker Compose configuration
- `.env.generated` - Environment variables for services
- `application-local.yml.generated` - Spring Boot configuration (if applicable)
